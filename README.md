RimDominion is a geopolitical overhaul that transforms RimWorld into a grand strategy experience. This mod introduces a settlement hierarchy, dynamic faction clustering, and a ruthless new victory condition: The Planet Holder.
Core Features
1. Settlement Hierarchy

The world map is no longer a collection of random outposts. Settlements now follow a strategic hierarchy:

    Capital: The faction's heart. It serves as the primary anchor for territory and possesses the strongest defenses.

    Settlement: Standard urban centers acting as logistical hubs.

    Village: Small outposts serving as the first line of defense.

2. Intelligent Clustering & Encirclement Logic

This mod patches the World Generator to create a more realistic geopolitical landscape:

    Faction Clusters: Settlements spawn in groups centered around their respective Capitals based on geographic proximity.

    Dynamic Loyalty (Encirclement): If a settlement is isolated or completely surrounded by foreign factions, its allegiance will automatically flip to the dominant neighbor to maintain territorial integrity.

3. "Total Annihilation" Siege System

Capture mechanics have been redesigned for total war:

    To capture a settlement, players must eliminate every single inhabitant on the local map.

    There is no surrender. Every defender must be neutralized before the city changes hands, forcing intense urban combat.

4. New Victory Condition: Planet Holder

Forget the spaceship. Kicking off the planet is for the weak. To win, you must achieve Global Hegemony by capturing every single settlement on the world map. You win when you are the last soul standing.
